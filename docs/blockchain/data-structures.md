# Data Structures & Storage

## Overview
This module covers the fundamental data structures used in blockchain systems, with a focus on practical implementation in Rust. We'll explore how blockchains store and manage data efficiently.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand core blockchain data structures
- Implement Merkle trees and hash chains
- Design efficient storage mechanisms
- Handle state management

## Core Concepts

### 1. Block Structure
- Block headers and metadata
- Transaction data organization
- Merkle tree implementation
- Chain linking mechanisms

### 2. Storage Mechanisms
- Block storage design
- State database management
- UTXO vs Account model
- Data indexing strategies

### 3. Implementation Components
- Hash pointer structures
- Merkle tree verification
- State trie implementation
- Database interactions

## Hands-on Project

### Building Core Data Structures
We'll implement:
- Basic block structure
- Merkle tree for transactions
- Simple state management
- Persistent storage system

### Implementation Steps
1. Block data structure
2. Merkle tree implementation
3. State management system
4. Storage interface design
