# Cryptography & Consensus

## Overview
Cryptography and consensus mechanisms are fundamental to blockchain security and decentralized agreement. This module covers the cryptographic primitives and consensus algorithms essential for blockchain development.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Cryptographic Fundamentals
- Hash Functions (SHA-256, Blake2, etc.)
- Public Key Cryptography
  - Key pairs generation
  - Digital signatures
  - Signature verification
- Merkle Trees basics

### 2. Consensus Mechanisms
- Proof of Work (PoW)
- Proof of Stake (PoS)
- Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)
- Consensus properties
  - Safety
  - Liveness
  - Fault tolerance

### 3. Implementation Components
- Digital signature scheme
  - Key generation
  - Message signing
  - Signature verification
- Basic consensus algorithm
- Block validation rules

## Project Goals
1. Implement a basic digital signature scheme
2. Create a simple consensus mechanism
3. Build block validation using cryptographic primitives
4. Implement a basic voting mechanism

## Hands-on Tasks
1. Generate and manage keypairs
2. Sign and verify messages
3. Implement a basic PoW algorithm
4. Create a simple voting consensus
