# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Before starting your blockchain development journey, ensure you have:

1. Basic programming knowledge
2. Development environment set up (see below)
3. Enthusiasm for learning blockchain technology

## Development Environment

### Required Tools
1. **Rust Installation**
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```
2. **Git** for version control
3. **VS Code** with rust-analyzer extension
4. A Unix-like environment (Linux/macOS, or WSL for Windows)

## Learning Path

Our journey is structured into two main tracks:

### 1. Rust Programming (6 Weeks)
- Week 1: [Ownership and Borrowing](./rust-learning/week1-ownership.md)
- Week 2: [Structs, Enums, Pattern Matching](./rust-learning/week2-structs.md)
- Week 3: Error Handling
- Week 4: Traits, Iterators, and Closures
- Week 5: Generics & Smart Pointers
- Week 6: Macros and Procedural Macros

ðŸ‘‰ Check out our [Rust Learning Resources](./rust-learning/resources.md) for additional materials!

### 2. Blockchain Development Pipeline
1. [Networking & P2P](./blockchain/networking.md)
2. [Cryptography & Consensus](./blockchain/cryptography.md)
3. Data Structures & Storage
4. Virtual Machine & Execution Model
5. Transaction Pool & Mempool
6. Smart Contracts & State Management
7. Scaling Solutions
8. Tokenomics
9. Privacy and Security
10. Cross-chain Integration
