# Week 2: Structs, Enums, and Pattern Matching

## Overview
This week focuses on Rust's custom data types and pattern matching capabilities, essential features for building complex systems.

## Topics Covered
- Structs implementation and usage
- Enums and their versatility
- Pattern matching techniques
- Working with `Option<T>`

## Key Concepts

### Structs
- Defining structs
- Struct methods and associated functions
- Struct update syntax
- Tuple structs and unit structs

### Enums
- Enum definition and variants
- Storing data in enums
- The Option enum
- Implementing methods on enums

### Pattern Matching
- `match` expressions
- Pattern types
- Match guards
- `if let` syntax
- `while let` syntax

## Project: Task Manager
Build a command-line task manager that demonstrates:
- Task struct with various fields
- Status enum for task states
- Pattern matching for task operations
- Option handling for task queries

### Project Requirements
1. Create tasks with title, description, due date
2. Mark tasks as pending/in-progress/completed
3. List tasks with different filters
4. Delete tasks
5. Update task status

### Learning Objectives
- Design custom types
- Implement methods
- Use pattern matching effectively
- Handle optional values
